_simple_wiki_ is just that: a simple wiki.

# Getting Started

## Install

If you have Go:

```
go install github.com/brendanjerwin/simple_wiki@latest
```

## Run

To run from the command line:

```shell
simple_wiki
```

and it will start a server listening on `0.0.0.0:8050`. To view it, just go to <http://localhost:8050> (the server prints out the local IP for your info if you want to do LAN networking). You can change the port with `-port X`, and you can listen _only_ on localhost using `-host localhost`.

## Server customization

There are a couple of command-line flags that you can use to make _simple_wiki_ your own micro-CMS.

```
simple_wiki -lock 123 -default-page index.html -css mystyle.css
```

The `-lock` flag will automatically lock every page with the passphrase "123". Also, the default behavior will be to redirect `/` to `/index.html`.

## Usage

_simple_wiki_ is straightforward to use. Here are some of the basic features:

### View all the pages

To view the current list of all the pages goto to `/ls`.

### Editing

When you open a document you'll be directed to an alliterative animal (which is supposed to be easy to remember). You can write in Markdown. Saving is performed as soon as you stop writing. You can easily link pages using [[PageName]] as you edit.

### History

You can easily see previous versions of your documents.

### Locking

Locking prevents other users from editing your pages without a passphrase.

## System Design

When a page is saved, its contents are saved to a .json file acting as a database of history for that page. The current version of the page is saved as a .md file.

The filename used is a hash of a "munged" version of the page name. "munging" helps common equivalency expectations be met. i.e. "Home" and "home" are equivalent.

Frontmatter in the markdown is used to store structured data that can be referenced by the templating system. This provides a means for slightly more dynamic content. (of particular note: this capability is at the core of the inventory usage pattern).

> **Note:** Frontmatter values are limited to strings, lists of strings, or nested maps. Other data types like numbers or booleans are not directly supported and should be stored as strings if needed.

> _simple_wiki_ is flexible when reading your pagesâ€”it understands both `---` (YAML) and `+++` (TOML) frontmatter, and it's smart enough to figure out what you meant even if you mix them up. When you save a page, however, it standardizes the format, gently nudging everything towards the obviously superior TOML `+++` format. This keeps things tidy under the hood.

When a page is saved, it is indexed for later searching. This index is also used to power some of the templating functions allowing for some structured data querying.
